# Angry Telegram Userbot
A fast, hard to setup telegram userbot written in python3 which uses [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/ "Pyrogram") Library.

Angry Telegram, also known as ATG, is your average Telegram userbot: it's faster, can load modules dynamically and is very hard to use!

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- API ID and Hash from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps)
- Some basic knowledege (although you can usually mindlessly copy&paste from the docs)

### Documentation
We didn't make any docs to help you to set-up the bot.
They can't be found, sorry.

### Support
We also have a dedicated Telegram support group. Got any doubts or issues while setting-up? Don't say them!
