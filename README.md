# Angry Telegram Userbot
[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/es3n1n/angry-telegram/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/es3n1n/angry-telegram/-/commits/master)

A fast, hard to setup telegram userbot written in python3 which uses [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/) Library.

Angry Telegram, also known as ATG, is your average Telegram userbot: it's faster, can load modules dynamically and is very hard to use!

### Requirements
- brain

### Documentation
We didn't make any docs to help you to set-up the bot.
They can't be found, sorry.

### Support
We also have a dedicated Telegram support group. Got any doubts or issues while setting-up? Don't say them!
